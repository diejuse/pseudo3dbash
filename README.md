# pseudo3dbash

A prototype of a pseudo 3d-engine made in Bash. 
Demo video: https://youtu.be/lQgtFwcaE-I

Now: 0.1 version

I love the old first-person grid-based pseudo 3d games (known as dungeon crawlers): Dungeon Master, Eye of the Beholder, Bloodwich, Hired Guns...
I decided as a challenge to create an ASCII graphics engine in BASH language to improve my programming level. 
Run on any Linux terminal. 

Who is interested can use my code to continue it. The only requirement of the license is to mention the source and me as the creator :)
